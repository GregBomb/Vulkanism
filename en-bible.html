    <h4>The Creation of our World</h4>
    <p>In the beginning, there was only darkness - a silence that overwhelmed even the gods. In this void existed Kirezek, The guardian of the Suns, a prisoner of monotony. He had spent millennia in the hot, fiery stars of the multiverse, but what use is power without creation? What use is light without someone to see it? Thus, Kirezek left the strict confines of his destiny of guarding the intergalactic stars and wandered through the void until he decided to forge a new universe—one that would bear his name and reflect his will.</p>
    <p>He took the raw matter of the cosmos and crafted with them, formed suns, and let planets orbit them. He drew lines of dust and transformed them into planets. The Milky Way was born under his hands, named for the divine essence he drew from his thoughts. But no creation is ever perfect. Too much matter accumulated in the outer worlds - thus Pluto, Uranus, and the moons were formed, remnants of an act of creation that went far beyond what was necessary.</p>
    <p>When Kirezek finally wanted to lay the foundation for life, he recognized a problem. Many planets were simply too massive, their gravity too big to sustain the spark of life. Others were too small, their atmospheres lost to the cold vacuum. But one planet, Earth, possessed the perfect balance. Here, and only here, would life flourish. With divine essence, he breathed its first breath into it and spat upon the Earth to create the oceans, and thus the primordial was born—a world where life could roam free.</p>
    <p>He watched with pride, as his creation grew, but a creation is never without flaws. As he rose in infinite joy, a fragment of his essence - his tooth, a symbol of his divine existence—broke away and hurtled toward Earth. The dinosaurs, the planet's first rulers, were wiped out. The order was disrupted, but from the destruction, a new possibility had risen.</p>
    <p>In his craving urge to create, Kirezek turned to another planet: Uranus. Here he proceeds to create a second civilization. But the beings he created there were afflicted by a fatal mistake – they understood power, but not responsibility. They made progress and began to establish civilizations. Kirezek watched and repeatedly sent messages, but the population didn't understand his messages, and in many places his followers were hunted and imprisoned. In anger, he caused volcanoes to erupt, but the people of Uranus didn't understand and started a nuclear war against each other. Thus, within a few millennia, they had already destroyed themselves in wars that forever scarred the planet's surface and covered it in an eternal blue ice shell. Upset about the Uranian stupidity, Kirezek returned to Earth and found a new creation - one he hadn't guided: The apes.</p>
    <p>These creatures were adaptable, guileful, and yet driven by instinct and chaos, and above all, stupidity. They knew no peace, only struggle. And so the War of the Apes ensued, a bloody era in which tribes hunted each other until only the strongest survived. Kirezek recognized in this the pattern that had also destroyed the creatures of Uranus. He knew that if he didn't intervene, the apes would destroy themselves - and with them the last spark of the life he had created.</p>
    <p>So he intervened. He took one of them, a warrior of relentless savagery, and reshaped him. He shaved his fur, beat his skull, and altered his shape until he became something new: the first human. But mere change of form wasn't enough—for the beings of Uranus had also possessed knowledge, but no purpose. So he placed in humans a gift that neither the apes nor the warriors of Uranus had possessed: the ability to perceive meaning: intelligence.</p>
    <p>But knowledge alone never leads to peace, said Kirezek. The Humans were wild and stubborn. They began to multiply and grow, but with them, their arrogance grew. They recognized the power of fire, but they forgot the one who had given it to them. So Kirezek spoke to them and revealed the only law that would prevent them from following the same path of destruction as the peoples before them: the worship of the volcano. Fire was not just destruction, no, it was purification, transformation, and order. Those who opposed fire would perish in it.</p>
    <p>And so Kirezek chose the highest peaks of the earth as his sacred places. He revealed himself in the eruptions, spoke through the rumbling of the earth. And as a warning, he placed a second world deep beneath the surface: the realm of oblivion, which the people would later call hell. There he banished those who against the fire. And as the guardian of this place, he placed Satan, who was not meant to be a punishment, but a reminder - a voice that would never be silenced. But people couldn't hear him. And they stigmatized him as the essence of pure evil, even though everything he had wanted, was to help humanity, but was scarred by the hell he had to endure. He grew up in his hell, but made it a place one could live in, if it weren't for the hundreds of degrees of unbearable temperature. Thus, humanity saw Satan as evil.</p>
    <p>Now that the world was in order, Kirezek withdrew into the oldest of all volcanoes. From there, he watches over his creation. But if people forget him, if they plunge into wars again, if they lose their connection to fire—then he will remind them. Then the fire will erupt, and the earth will tremble. And when the humanity shall feel his anger, Kirezek will send catastrophes. The angrier he is, the hotter he makes the earth, but, as far as today, this has never been necessary. Humans have already done it themselves.</p>
    <p>For fire is the origin and the end. And whoever honors the fire will not burn in it, but will be reborn.</p>
