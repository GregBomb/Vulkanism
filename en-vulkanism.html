  <h4>The official state religion of the state Hakam</h4>
  <p>Have you ever admired the true power of the volcano? At the Church of Volcano, or Vulkanism, we understand this power as the divine presence that both gives and takes life. The volcano is not just a natural phenomenon, but rather a true god who is watching over all of our lives, and sends signs and messages through its powerful eruptions. These eruptions are an expression of its anger, and must be balanced by mass sacrifices to appease its fury.</p>
  <p>We firmly believe that the volcano is the only source of truth and justice. Its flames purify the world of impurities, and guide us to our path of  the light. Our priests, the keepers of this sacred knowledge, have learned to interpret the volcano's signs and guide us to receive its favor.</p>
  <p>The Holy Land of Vulkanism is the Lietz Atoll, where the "Master Volcano" stands. This volcano is the origin and primeval spark of our hope. Every year, on August 17th, believers from all over the world make a pilgrimage to this volcano. The Lietz Atoll and the Master Volcano are the spiritual center and holy land of our religion.</p>
  <p>In the Church of Volcano, you will experience the true meaning of devotion and enlightenment. Our rituals and ceremonies, including the sacred sacrifices, are acts of the deepest faith and the highest honor. Those who sacrifice their lives to the volcano are venerated as holy martyrs, whose souls rest forever in the divine light of the volcano.</p>
  <p>Another important feature of our faith is the Djungelskog, who, along with the volcano, represents the child of the volcano god and a panda. He is the Messiah and can help us all with his infinite wisdom. The Djungelskog is always in the hands of the Supreme Pope, Konstantin. He has control over the Djungelskog and is the most important and highest-ranking human member of our faith.</p>
  <p>During daily prayers, believers place their hands in boiling water, symbolizing the lava of the Master Volcano, and recite the following lines:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Holy Volcano, purify my soul.</li>
      <li>Holy Volcano, protect me from all evil.</li>
      <li>Holy Volcano, grant me your wisdom.</li>
      <li>Holy Volcano, guide me on my path.</li>
      <li>Holy Volcano, let me be your servant.</li>
      <li>The volcano  will be holy for all of eternity.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>During the annual pilgrimage, believers inhale the volcanic fumes as a sign of the inner peace granted by the Master Volcano. They also pierce their hands with a nail to the volcano to show their devotion and gain its favor. The blood that flows symbolically represents the pain we all experience in everyday life, which flows away, out of the soul.</p>
  <p>Our faith is the irrefutable truth. The blessing of the volcano touches every aspect of our lives and leads us to a higher level of being. The Church of Volcano offers you the unique opportunity to be part of a community enlightened and empowered by faith in the volcano. Join us and recognize the true power and grace of the volcano. Together, under the protection of this divine being, we can live a life of abundance and enlightenment.</p>
